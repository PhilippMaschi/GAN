** KEYWORDS
n_epochs: defines how many repetitions of training using the whole training set will be performed.
n_batch:
latent_dim: latent space, where the noise is created

** IMPORTANT PARAMETERS
NOISE higher it is, better it is
BATCH SIZE 8-16, max 64. if it is too high, overwhelm the discriminator or overpower the generator
LOSS FUNCTION there are several. it is worth to try them out:
- binary cross entropy ('vanilla GANs) --- discrete
- Wasserstein (WGANs) ---- good
